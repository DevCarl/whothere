# The aim of this moudle will be to scan through the database and generate derived data where possible.
# This module will also generate indexes and derived tables

# An example of this is that all modules starting first number represents their level


import nose2
import pymysql


def derived_data_and_generate_indexs_from_db():

    return 1


# Room table => derived building no / floor no / plug friendly

# Module table => Facility / course level / undergrad

# Buildings auto insert list

# Generate derived table
